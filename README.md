# PictureRenameConsoleApp
Small command line tool to rename all jpg photos in a location to the date and time the photo was taken.


## How it works

This tool will take all JPGs at a given folder location and attempt to rename them to the date and time the photo was taken. 
If that info cant be found it will leave the photo untouched. An output file with the results of the run will be generated listing the successfully changed photos, 
as well as the failed ones.
